# SignPay

## Overview

SignPay allows users to send and receive credits via digital signatures. Users can pledge work-hours as credits in exchange for goods and services. Once a user accumulates credit-hours they can chain them to new transactions, but since there is no centralized ledger, double spend attacks must be prevented by the individual reputation of the creditor.
